# Cognifyz Technologies - Data Analysis Internship
This repository contains my internship project completed at ""Cognifyz Technologies"" as part of the Data Analysis Internship.  
The goal of this project was to analyze restaurant data to gain insights into customer ratings, geographic distribution, and review patterns.  

I worked on "Level 2" and "Level 3" tasks, focusing on data visualization, insights generation, and advanced analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.


## Tasks Completed

### Level 2
- ""Restaurant Ratings"": Analyzed the distribution of aggregate ratings.  
- ""Geographic Analysis"": Visualized restaurants by country and city.  

### Level 3
- ""Restaurant Reviews"": Explored rating texts and their relationship with ratings.  
- ""Votes Analysis"": Studied how customer votes correlate with restaurant ratings.
